# cron

This is a straight fork from https://github.com/robfig/cron with (currently) two additional PRs merged:
* [Get the previous schedule time](https://github.com/robfig/cron/pull/361)
* [Support for 'L' expression](https://github.com/robfig/cron/pull/325)

I'll try my best to keep this up to date, tested and merge additional PRs moving forward.
